    hungarian(costMat) -> (assignment, cost)

Find an optimal solution of the rectangular assignment problem represented by
the ``N x M`` matrix `costMat`. Return the optimal column indices and
corresponding minimal cost.

The `costMat[n,m]` denotes the `cost` to assign the `n`th worker to the `m`th job.
The zero element in the return value `assignment` means that these workers have
no assigned job.

Elements in the matrix can be set to `missing`. In this case, the corresponding
matching cannot be considered by the algorithm.

             12    19    21;
